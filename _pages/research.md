ADMM
======
*Background:* ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) was proposed 40 years ago and recently attracted lots of attention. The convergence of 2-block ADMM for convex problems was known; however, a recent paper in 2014 showed that multi-block ADMM can diverge even for solving a 3*3 linear system. Interestingly, if we randomly permuted the update order in each cycle (e.g. (132), (231),... compared to traditional cyclic order (123), (123),...), then the algorithm converges. The question is: why?
